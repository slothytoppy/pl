this project is unnamed for now, the name is just pl (programming language)
i dont know what i'll name it however the language will be c-ish, it will have the usual constructs that most languages have, i will try to not have a preprocessor at most i'll probably have a c like "proprocessor" that just copy and pastes the file. including files will have two options, one is a full file include, the other will be only including certain things from that file. I also want the language to be able to parse C so that it can natively parse it for coverting c libraries to be compilable with my language. 

the MVP (minimal valid program) will probably look something like C's hello world.

if you want to make your own compiler for this it will have to be platform specific, for now im going to be targetting linux and x86, i do plan on making it cross-platform (different versions of the compiler for different operating systems and cpus).
